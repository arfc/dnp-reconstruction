# Tests

## Integration

### Test 1
This is a basic test that uses test data, pure U235 fission, and independent fission yields.

### Test 2
This test builds off test 1 and changes the fissions such that half come from U238.

### Test 3
This test changes the fissile fraction, but keeps U235 and U238. However, it tests cumulative fission yields instead of independent.

### Test 4
Continues the cumulative fission yield test but with real data instead of test data.

### Test 5
Uses 1000 Monte Carlo samples of the data to generate uncertainties.

### Test 6
Tests a mostly empty input file.
